								<p>The "Urban Sequence" regeneration report has been commissioned by Maccreanor Lavington to guide the revitalization of Birkenhead's Dock Branch. The aim of this regeneration plan is to establish a sustainable and vibrant environment by tightly connecting the dock branch through industry upgrading, railway heritage reuse, and the creation of a green community. The report consists of four stages of analysis and concludes with a comprehensive action plan.

									<p>The baseline and site analysis have identified several core problems plaguing the dock branch. These include underutilized land, outdated and scattered industries, a shortage of housing options, limited open green spaces, and concerns regarding the well-being of residents. Given these challenges, a comprehensive regeneration of the dock branch is necessary to transform its appearance and address these issues.

									<p>Our regeneration plan focuses on three key points. Firstly, we propose upgrading the local industry from traditional manufacturing to green innovation, creating a vibrant economic hub. Secondly, we aim to tackle the housing problem by constructing a variety of housing types that cater to different affordability levels, fostering a thriving co-living community. Lastly, we emphasize the reuse of railway heritage and the establishment of a linear park to connect different districts, knitting the city together.

										<p>All proposed actions will be supported by relevant policies, and careful consideration has been given to budgeting and funding requirements. This regeneration plan is expected to span a period of at least seven years, ensuring sufficient time for implementation and monitoring. The Wirral Council, Maccreanor Lavington, investors, local residents, and other stakeholders will collaborate closely to align the dock branch's development with the council's ambitions.
										
											<p>Overall, our urban planning proposal presents a comprehensive strategy to regenerate the Birkenhead Dock Branch, establishing a sustainable, vibrant, and inclusive community that reflects the vision and aspirations of all stakeholders involved.
