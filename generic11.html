							<h1>WALKING ATOP A STEEL NET </h1>

								<p>This project aims to reshape the unwanted
									or recycled steels as landscape elements, extending their life span from landfills to key
									elements making up vibrant public space for people. Steel has high tensile strength and
									low cost, “Steel is more flexible than rubber”. It has been shaped into many forms through
									divide, pull, push, stretch, bend and wrinkle. I use Corten steel net to pave the ground
									define the edge between vegetation species, hardscape and softscape, and different
									activities zones. Considering the wire rope nets come in various cable thickness, steel
									cables with larger radius and denser mesh sizes have distinctive advantages in shaping the
									terrain due to their playful, flexible, and transparent net structure.						</p>

								<p2>Background</p2>
								<p>As steel becomes central in modern industrial production, 70% steel are produced through oxygen furnace that
								make up 10% of global GHG emissions. Worse still, 30% of the global economy was spent on steel corrosion.
								However, steel is one of the world's most-recycled materials, with a recycling rate of 83% in the United
								States. Therefore, it necessary to reshape the unwanted or recycled steels as landscape elements, extending
								their life span from landfills to key elements making up vibrant public space for people.
							</p>
							<p2>Concept</p2>
							<p>Tension has its graphic and metaphoric indications. Inspired by the picture Lunch Atop A Skyscraper depicting
								New York Workers in the 1930s, I found that lines and surface elements all together shape the perception of
								tension and stress. In the physical world, tension is described as the pulling force transmitted through a rope,
								string, chain, or cable. Steel has high tensile strength and low cost, Quote from a scientist, “Steel is more
								flexible than rubber”. It has been shaped into many forms through divide, pull, push, stretch, bend and
								wrinkle.
							</p>	
								<p2>Material selection</p2>
								<p>Corten steel has been widely used in outdoor landscaping as a low-maintenance material due to its antierosive nature, especially in Boston’s wet, rainy, and enduring winter. I use Corten steel to define the edge
								between vegetation species, hardscape and softscape, and different activities zones. Stainless steel wire rope
								nets can be stretched in a three-dimensional shape. They are widely used in fencing and railing, but seldom
								used in paving the ground. Considering the wire rope nets come in various cable thickness, steel cables with
								larger radius and denser mesh sizes have distinctive advantages in shaping the terrain due to their playful,
								flexible, and transparent net structure. And they have a long lifespan.
							</p>
								<p2>Grid and plan iteration</p2>
								<p>Initially, I divide the site into grids at 30° and -45° angles, which felt overly artificial. Grids slightly tilted
								from the straight lines seemed to produce more tension. Orthogonal grids provided a sense of stability, so I
								arranged the horizontal and vertical grids to form acute angles.
							</p>
								<p2>Seasonal human activities</p2>
								<p>During the summer, the square experiences relatively consistent sunlight hours, while in the winter, sunlight is
								primarily concentrated on the northern side of the site. To maximize winter sunlight exposure, I introduced a
								climbing slope on the northern side, allowing people to bask in the sun. Shady spots in the summer are found
								on the western side of the site, where I placed some seating for relaxation.
							</p>
								<p2>Steel as experiential surface</p2>
								<p>Initially, I used a high-rise canopy to conceptualize observable tension. However, I realized that the landscape
								should interact with people rather than being solely for observation. I pondered how to combine tension with
								human experiences, and this process also involved manipulating the topography. Ultimately, I concluded that
								wire netting itself could be used to shape the terrain, simplifying the design. I envisioned the courtyard's
								topography as a continuous surface constructed with steel wire ropes on top of planted soil, sloping gently
								from north to south while maintaining a walkable path. I reduced the overall height range to enhance the
								pedestrian experience, making every corner of the net a vibrant urban space.
