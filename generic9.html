							<h1>STRUCTURING FLOWS </h1>
							<t1>Fall 23' | 7 weeks | GSD MLA First Semester Core Studio | Individual Work | Instructed by Kira Clingen | Boston, MA </t1>

								<p>Form is the diagram of force. What we see today was produced by the flows yesterday. Form
									determines structures, and structure determines flows (Forman, 2013). This design responds to the
									existing and proposed urban adjacencies across the Herter Park boundary and varying degrees
									of wetness throughout the park itself and reconnects them through two pathway systems that
									structure the flow of people, the flow of water, and the flow of landforms to create different
									levels of interactions between humans and water. 
								</p>

									<p2>Urban Diagram | Reimagining Disconnection As Opportunities
								<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic69.png" alt="" /><br>
								<p> Addressing the increasing density resulting from the impact of the future redevelopment plan, this proposal focuses on the critical issues of connection and activation within Herter Park. Soldier's Field Road is a man-made, huge asphalt structure that channels the flow of people. The prevailing obstacle disrupts community connectivity and hinders the park's recreational and ecological potential due to high-speed traffic, making it unable to serve existing and future communities that are moving in with the redevelopment of the parkâ€™s urban edge. The impending redevelopment plan, however, offers an opportunity to reimagine the road as a gateway, fostering a renewed connection between Lower Allston and the Charles River.

								<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic68.png" alt="" />
									<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic70.png" alt="" />
	
										<br><p>	The main objective is to facilitate easy access for Lower Allston residents to the park and Boston's green network. This is achieved by transforming Soldier's Field Road into a linear plaza, marked by multiple openings on both sides. Simultaneously, the design seeks to activate underutilized spaces through two distinct pathway systems. A zigzag, 15-foot-wide pathway connects bike lanes and waterfront promenades, ensuring the appreciation of the littoral environment without compromising speed movement. A curvilinear, 8-foot-wide route unfolds in various forms (bridge, pier, submersible boardwalk, etc.), encircling passive to active recreational spaces and providing intimate, slow-paced vistas and engagement with water landscapes. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic85.jpg" alt="" />

								<p>	 The sequence of active and passive recreation spaces enriches the park experience. Shaded forest trails and a community garden provide a tranquil setting, while a multi-generational gathering island hosts fishing and a children's playground. The confluence water plaza offers opportunities for swimming and picnicking, while wetland boardwalks and woodland loops cater to birdwatching enthusiasts.

								<br><p2>Overlaying Two Pathway Systems | 7 Major Intersections, 3 Spatial Relationships 
									<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic71.png" alt="" />

								<p>	The two pathway systems structure the flow of vistas and landscape experiences and form three spatial relationships: departure, convergence, and
interwoven. I was interested to explore how such relationships could structure the levels of activity and wetness in my three transects.
</p>
								<p3>Transect 1: Departure | Water Plaza
								<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic72.jpg" alt="" /> <span>
								</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic82.jpg" alt="" /> <span>
							</p><p>Transect 1, Water Plaza, considers the streetscape of the new parkway, introducing roadside parking, and playing with new water features within a continuous water body, including a fountain, swimming pool, and stream. 
									</p>
							</p><span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic76.png" alt="" /> <span>
							</p><span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic75.png" alt="" /> <span>

							</p>	
							<br><br><br><p3>Transect 2: Convergence | Filtration Wetland
									<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic73.jpg" alt="" />
								</p>	
							</p><span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic82.jpg" alt="" /> <span>
							</p><p>Transect 2, Filtration Wetland, concentrates on redesigning the underused amphitheater and developing planting schemes for water infiltration, fostering immersive experiences along a linear walkway where water converges.

							</p><span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic79.png" alt="" /> <span>
							</p><span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic78.png" alt="" /> <span>

							</p>
								<br><br><br><p3>Transect 3: Interwoven | Pond Loop
								<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic74.jpg" alt="" />
								</p><span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic84.jpg" alt="" /> <span>

								</p><p>	In Transect 3, Pond Loop, the focus shifts to strategically managing rainwater runoff and riverside flooding through retention and detention ponds. Topographic variations create a nuanced transition from the tranquil Harvard campus to busier, mixed-use areas, accommodating various wetness levels in different flooding scenarios.
								</p><span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic80.png" alt="" /> <span>

								</p>
									<br><br><p2>Design Detail | Transect 1 Cross-section
										<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic77.png" alt="" />

								<p>
									Through the introduction of two pathway systems, multiple public spaces will be activated through different sizes of gathering and movement, which are envisioned to breathe new life to lower Allston residents and create linkages in a broader Boston green network system.
									The form of the proposed design serves as a visualization of dynamic forces, reflecting the intricate interplay between varying wetness levels and the desired human-nature interactions within Herter Park.
